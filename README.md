# Trivia-O-War
Trivia-O-War is a classic take on trivia questions that tests the player on the subject at hand; in this case basic JavaScript fundamentals. The game features trivia questions about JavaScript fundamentals assigned at random with four multiple choice questions containing 1 correct answer and 3 incorrect answers. The goal of the game is for the player to recognize these JavaScript fundamentals while answering the trivia accordingly. Each correct answer adds 8 points to your score and each incorrect answer removes 4 points from your score. Take caution, if you answer the first question wrong, you lose the game.

# Overcoming Hurdles
    Some of the major hurdles/problems that I had during this project were re-designing the major concept of the game. It was first set out to be a two player game with two different scores and two different characters pulling each other in a tug-o-war fashion based on answering trivia. Creating a structure in which the characters would move across the screen was my first problem, I had scraped it entirely and insted opted for a point system. My second obstacle was keeping track of who the points would be assigned to when a question was answered, because my player was originally selected at random, I wa confused on how to keep track of the players and their points. So I opted into making the game a single player game, in which the player wins by reaching a set amount of points. These problems, unfortunately unsolved, are some that I plan on coming back to with hope that I have more knowledge in JavaScript to tackle those functionalities including coming back to complete the stretch goals that I had in mind.
