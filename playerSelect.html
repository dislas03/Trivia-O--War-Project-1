            <h1>How To Play</h1>
            <p>Players take turns answering trivia questions, racking up points as questions are answered correctly!</p>
            <p>The player set to start the game off is selected at random</p>
            <p>Each question correctly answered adds 10 points to your score and the turn is passed to your opponent!</p>
            <p>If any question is answered incorrectly, 5 points are deducted from your score and your turn is passed to your opponent!</p>
            <p>The first player to reach a score of 100 points is declared the winner!</p>
            <p>Good luck and enjoy the game!</p>
